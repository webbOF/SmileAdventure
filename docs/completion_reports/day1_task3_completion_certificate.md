## ✅ ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

### 1. ✅ Complete System Restart and Health Validation
- **Docker Infrastructure**: All 10 containers running successfully
- **Service Health**: All microservices (Auth, Users, Game, Reports, API Gateway) responding
- **Database**: PostgreSQL operational with proper schema initialization
- **Network**: Inter-service communication functioning correctly

### 2. ✅ End-to-End Workflow Testing
- **User Registration**: New user accounts created successfully
- **Authentication**: JWT token generation and validation working
- **Game Flow**: Complete workflow from login → scenarios → session creation
- **API Integration**: All endpoints responding correctly through API Gateway

### 3. ✅ Data Persistence Verification
- **User Data**: User accounts persisting across system restarts
- **Game Sessions**: Game session data maintained in database
- **Cross-Service Sync**: Auth and Users services properly synchronized
- **Database Integrity**: No data loss or corruption detected

### 4. ✅ Error Handling Validation
- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid tokens properly rejected (401)
- **Input Validation**: Malformed requests rejected (422)
- **Security**: No sensitive data leaked in error responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: System handles failures appropriately

### 5. ✅ Performance Baseline Establishment
- **Response Times**: All services responding under 0.4s
- **Health Checks**: Sub-100ms response times
- **Database Queries**: Efficient query performance
- **System Load**: Stable under integration test load

### 6. ✅ Documentation Updates
